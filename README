This project was made to demonstrate how one can start up a win32 / OpenGL 3.x without using libraries such as GLEW and GLFW.

You can find the relevant blog post for this project [here](http://southstar.io/post/2018-06-25-opengl-basic-win32-setup-without-dependencies/).

Installation and Setup:
- CMake 3.7+ installed.
- cd <project dir>
- ./win32_build.bat
- run from Visual Studio

Notes:
- I did not include all OpenGL functions nor will you need all the OpenGL functions I included. I left them there to show the user how the fill out the macro list. Please adjust to your specific needs.
